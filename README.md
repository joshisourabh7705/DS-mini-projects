            2. every project contain a word document named report which is a documentation of the project. Although prepared cautiously it may contain some mistakes.
            3. The evaluation values provided are from Third-party softwares and may have wrong values.
            4. some project ideas may not be original and may be copied from outer references.
            5. *the projects here may contain some programs which are modified using ai tools (such as chatGPT, Gemini, Blackbox etc.).
